# Introduction to Humanoid Robotics & Embodied Intelligence

Welcome to "Humanoid Robotics & Embodied Intelligence," a technical book designed for intermediate AI/ML, robotics, and software engineering students. This book provides a complete guided pathway from digital AI models to physical humanoid robot behavior.

## What You Will Learn

Throughout this book, you will delve into the core pillars of modern robotics:

-   **ROS 2 Humanoid Control**: Master the fundamentals of controlling humanoid robots using the Robot Operating System (ROS 2).
-   **Digital Twins**: Create and interact with digital twins of humanoid robots in simulation environments like Gazebo and Unity.
-   **Perception and Navigation**: Implement perception and navigation systems using Isaac Sim, enabling your robots to understand and move within their environment.
-   **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems**: Explore the cutting-edge of AI by building systems that can understand natural language and perform complex tasks.

By the end of this book, you will be able to simulate, control, and program humanoid robots, giving you a strong foundation in the field of embodied intelligence.

## Who Should Read This Book

This book is for students and engineers who have a foundational understanding of programming (preferably Python) and an interest in AI, machine learning, and robotics.

Let's begin this exciting journey into the world of humanoid robotics!
