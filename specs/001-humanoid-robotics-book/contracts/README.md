# API Contracts for Technical Book: Humanoid Robotics & Embodied Intelligence

This directory is intended for API contracts (e.g., OpenAPI/GraphQL schemas) for projects that involve exposed APIs.

For this technical book project, the "Functional Requirements" and "User Scenarios" describe interactions a student has with the book's content, code examples, and simulated environments, rather than with an exposed API provided by the book itself. Therefore, formal API contracts are not applicable in the traditional sense for this project.

If future extensions involve creating a web service or interactive platform alongside the book, this directory would then be utilized.
