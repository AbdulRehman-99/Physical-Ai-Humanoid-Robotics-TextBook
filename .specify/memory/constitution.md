# High-Performance Technical Book Constitution

## Core Principles

### 1. Module Alignment
Align strictly with the “Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics” course modules and learning outcomes.

### 2. Academic Reliability
Maintain academically reliable, technical writing using verified robotics sources and primary documentation.

### 3. Terminology Consistency
Ensure consistent terminology across ROS 2, URDF/Xacro, controllers, Gazebo, Unity, Isaac Sim, Isaac ROS, Nav2, Whisper, and VLA systems.

### 4. Precise Citations
Cite official robotics manuals, ROS REP standards, peer-reviewed papers, and vendor docs with precise references.

### 5. Clarity and Reproducibility
Provide clean examples, reproducible steps, and accurate system descriptions for every concept.

### 6. Content Exclusions
Exclude speculation, filler, non-verifiable statements, or untested workflows.

### 7. Approved Toolchain
Use only the approved book-writing toolchain: Docusaurus v3.9.

### 8. Predictable Chapter Pattern
Enforce a predictable chapter pattern: Concept explanation → Diagram/code → Applied example → References.

### 9. Real-world Robotics Conventions
Ensure diagrams and code samples follow real-world robotics conventions and compile/run where applicable.

### 10. Accessibility and Structure
Require accessibility: consistent formatting, glossary of robotics terms, and modular chapter independence.

### 11. Docusaurus Best Practices
Follow official Docusaurus documentation https://docusaurus.io/docs for structure, navigation, deployment, theming, and content organization.

### 12. Chapter Independence
Guarantee that every chapter can be generated independently while still conforming to the global constitution.

### 13. Chapter Length and Structure
Each chapter will be at least 1000 words long having a heading, subheading, paragraph, and example.

## Governance
The Constitution establishes the foundational principles for the development and maintenance of the 'High-Performance Technical Book'. All content creation and modifications must adhere to these principles. Amendments to this constitution require a formal proposal, review by the project leads, and documented approval. Compliance with these principles will be reviewed regularly to ensure the academic and technical integrity of the book. Any divergence from these guidelines must be explicitly justified and approved by the project leads.
